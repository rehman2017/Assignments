#19. callable() and __call__()
#Assignment:
#Create a class Multiplier with an __init__() to set a factor. Define a __call__() method that multiplies an input by the factor. Test it with callable() and by calling the object like a function.


class Multiplier:
    def __init__(self, factor):
        self.factor = factor

    def __call__(self, value):
        return value * self.factor

# Example usage
times_three = Multiplier(3)

# Check if the object is callable
print("Is callable?", callable(times_three))  # True

# Call the object like a function
result = times_three(10)
print("Result:", result)
