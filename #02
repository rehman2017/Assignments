#2. Using cls
#Assignment:
#Create a class Counter that keeps track of how many objects have been created. Use a class variable and a class method with cls to manage and display the count.

class Counter:
    count = 0  # Class variable to keep track of the number of objects

    def __init__(self):
        Counter.count += 1  # Increment count every time a new object is created

    @classmethod
    def display_count(cls):
        print("Total objects created:", cls.count)

# Example usage:
obj1 = Counter()
obj2 = Counter()
obj3 = Counter()
obj4 = Counter()
obj5 = Counter()

Counter.display_count()
