#6. Constructors and Destructors
#Assignment:
#Create a class Logger that prints a message when an object is created (constructor) and another message when it is destroyed (destructor).



class Logger:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Logger initialized. Object created.")

    def __del__(self):
        print("Logger terminated. Object destroyed.")

# Example usage:
log = Logger()

# Forcing deletion (in real scenarios, this happens when object goes out of scope)
del log
